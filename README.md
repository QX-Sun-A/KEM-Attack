KEM-Attack code implementation

## Dataset

The `data/` directory contains four benchmark text classification datasets:

| Dataset    | #Classes | Samples | Avg. Length |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **MR**     | 2        | 1,000   | 20          |
| **IMDB**   | 2        | 1,000   | 215         |
| **Yelp**   | 2        | 1,000   | 152         |
| **AG's News** | 4      | 1,000   | 43          |

Each dataset contains 1,000 correctly classified test samples formatted for direct use.
